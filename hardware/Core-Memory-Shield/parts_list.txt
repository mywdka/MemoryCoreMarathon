Below is the list of necessary parts for building a magnetic core memory
Arduino shield v1.1.  We found all of these parts (including the cores
themselves) easily available on at least one of http://www.ebay.com and
http://www.farnell.com and had our PCBs manufactured by
http://www.eurocircuits.com.

One important note is that the value of the four drive resistors, listed
as 18ohm, may need to be adjusted if the cores used are sufficiently
different to ours.
